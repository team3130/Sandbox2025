    Exercise 2: Variables

    1 variable has been demonstrated for you. This shows some syntax
    and Camel Case which is important in convention. Now Make one of each type of variables.
    Make sure to have your variables as static for now.
    Later this will change

    //are not just printing a random value and give some context.
