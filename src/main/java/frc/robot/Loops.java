     * Use a while loop and a for loop to recreate the exponent function

     * up to you to create everything from variables to psvm to
     * scanner
     * 
     * Exercise 2
     * use a nested loop with both while loops and for loops to ask for an input
     * and make sure it is present. The for loop should act to emulate the exponent function
     * same as before
